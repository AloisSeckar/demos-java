⚙️ Key Changes in JDK 25

No Experimental Flags Needed: The -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions flag is no longer required to enable generational mode. Users can now enable it directly with:


-XX:+UseShenandoahGC -XX:ShenandoahGCMode=generational

This change simplifies the command-line configuration for users.

Default Mode Remains Single Generation: The default behavior of Shenandoah continues to be single-generation mode. Users must explicitly specify -XX:ShenandoahGCMode=generational to enable the generational mode.

Extensive Testing and Stability: The generational mode has undergone rigorous testing across multiple platforms and workloads, including DaCapo, SPECjbb2015, SPECjvm2008, and Heapothesys, demonstrating significant performance and stability improvements.
