/**
 * # JEP 462: Structured Concurrency (Second Preview)
 *
 * Structured Concurrency simplifies multithreaded programming by treating groups of related tasks
 * running in different threads as a single unit of work.
 *
 * ## History:
 * - Introduced as Incubator API in JDK 19 (JEP 428).
 * - Refined through multiple preview stages (JEP 437, JEP 453).
 * - This is the second preview in JDK 23.
 *
 * ## Key Idea:
 * - Replace unstructured thread management with a structured scope.
 * - Parent tasks manage child tasks with well-defined lifecycles.
 *
 * ## External Resources:
 * - [JEP 462](https://openjdk.org/jeps/462)
 * - [Inside Java Podcast: Structured Concurrency](https://inside.java)
