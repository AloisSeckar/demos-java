        // JEP 382 replaced the internal rendering pipeline used by the Java 2D API on macOS.
        // The old pipeline used Apple's OpenGL API, which was deprecated by Apple in macOS 10.14 Mojave.
        // The new pipeline uses Apple's modern Metal API.

        // --- Why was this change needed? ---
        // 1. Deprecation: Apple deprecated OpenGL, signaling its eventual removal. Staying on OpenGL
        //    risked future incompatibility with macOS updates.
        // 2. Performance & Features: Metal is Apple's modern graphics API, offering better performance
        //    and access to newer GPU features compared to the older OpenGL.
        // 3. Consistency: Aligns Java's rendering on macOS with the direction of the platform.

        // --- What does it mean for developers? ---
        // - This is an INTERNAL change to the JDK.
        // - Ideally, Java applications using Swing/AWT (Java 2D) on macOS should continue to work
        //   without any code changes.
        // - Users might observe performance improvements or changes in rendering behavior on macOS.
        // - The public Java 2D API itself did not change.

        // --- How to observe the effect? ---
        // - Run Java applications using Swing/AWT on macOS with JDK 17+ and compare performance
        //   or visual fidelity against older JDK versions (if possible).
        // - Check system properties or logs (if available) related to rendering pipelines, though
        //   this might require deeper JVM introspection. The system property `sun.java2d.opengl`
        //   might have been relevant previously, but the new pipeline uses Metal.

        // Since this is an internal implementation detail, there's no specific Java code
        // to demonstrate the switch from OpenGL to Metal directly. The effect is primarily
        // on runtime behavior and compatibility on macOS.
