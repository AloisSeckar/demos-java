     * # JEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1
     * 
     * **Release**: JDK 24  
     * **Type**: Feature  
     * **Component**: HotSpot / Compiler  
     * **Authors**: Roberto Castañeda Lozano, Erik Österlund  
     * **Reviewed by**: Thomas Schatzl, Vladimir Kozlov  
     * 
     * ## Summary
     * Shifts G1 barrier expansion from early in the C2 compiler pipeline (IR creation)
     * to the very end (code emission) to:
     * - Reduce C2 compilation overhead (10–20%)
     * - Decouple G1 internals from deep C2 knowledge
     * - Improve maintainability and performance
     * 
     * ## Motivation
     * The early barrier expansion model caused:
     * - Higher C2 compilation times
     * - Difficult-to-maintain code requiring deep C2 expertise
     * - Hard-to-ensure instruction ordering and correctness
     * 
     * Switching to **late expansion** addresses these issues by generating
     * barrier code just before machine code emission, avoiding interference
     * with C2’s optimization pipeline.
     * 
     * ## Implementation Highlights
     * - Memory accesses are **tagged** with barrier info during IR generation
     * - Barriers are **emitted** only during code generation
     * - Reuses **ZGC mechanisms** for tagging and expansion
     * 
     * ## Optimizations
     * - Remove barriers for writes into new objects
     * - Simplify based on nullness info
     * - Remove redundant compression/decompression ops
     * - Optimize layout to keep hot paths clean
     * 
     * ## Impact
     * This change is **transparent** to most users but:
     * - Reduces JVM overhead
     * - Improves performance on cloud workloads
     * 
     * ## Resources
     * - [JEP 475](https://openjdk.org/jeps/475)
     * - [ZGC: JEP 377](https://openjdk.org/jeps/377)

            This JEP changes when G1 Garbage Collector write/read barriers are expanded during JIT compilation.
            
            Previously:
              - Barriers were expanded early, during bytecode-to-IR phase
              - Resulted in 10–20% extra C2 compilation overhead
              - Required deep knowledge of C2 compiler internals

            Now:
              - Barriers are expanded late, at code emission stage
              - Reduces C2 workload
              - Simplifies GC development
              - Reuses existing interpreter assembly barrier code

            Benefits:
              - Better performance in C2 compilation
              - Easier to maintain and evolve GC barriers
              - Lower complexity for future barrier optimizations

            Limitations:
              - No direct way to observe this in regular Java apps
              - Testing/benchmarking is internal to HotSpot/JVM developers
