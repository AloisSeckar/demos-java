/// # JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal
///
/// @author mayankvyas1306
///
/// ## Summary
/// This JEP deprecates the finalization mechanism for removal in a future release. Finalization,
/// using the `finalize()` method, has been a problematic and dangerous feature since Java 1.0.
/// It is unpredictable, slow, and can lead to security vulnerabilities and resource leaks.
///
/// ## Release Information
/// - **JEP:** 421
/// - **Status:** Delivered
/// - **Release:** JDK 18
/// - **Component:** core-libs/java.lang
///
/// ## Resources
/// - [JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal](https://openjdk.org/jeps/421)

            JEP 421 officially deprecates finalization for removal. The `finalize()` method,
            intended to clean up resources before an object is garbage collected, is fundamentally flawed.

            --- Why Finalization is Deprecated ---

            1.  **Unpredictable:** There's no guarantee *when* or even *if* a finalizer will run.
            2.  **Performance Penalty:** The mere presence of a `finalize()` method slows down garbage collection.
            3.  **Security Risks:** Finalizers can "resurrect" objects from partially initialized
                constructors, leading to unstable and insecure states.
            4.  **Difficult to Use Correctly:** It's hard to write correct, thread-safe finalizers.

            --- Key Changes in JDK 18 ---

            1.  **Deprecation for Removal:** The `Object.finalize()` method is now marked with
                `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`. Compiling a class with a `finalize()` method
                will now generate a warning.

            2.  **New Command-Line Option:** A new flag, `--finalization=disabled`, was added to
                completely disable finalization at runtime. This is for testing how an application
                will behave when finalization is eventually removed.

            --- Modern Alternatives ---

            Developers should use superior, more reliable alternatives for resource management:
            - **`try-with-resources`:** For resources that have a clear lexical scope.
            - **`java.lang.ref.Cleaner`:** For managing the cleanup of objects when they become unreachable,
              without the flaws of finalization.
